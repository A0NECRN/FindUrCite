Abstract—We present a cost-aware benchmarking frame-
work for financial LLMs and validate it through rigor-
ous empirical analysis. The framework centers on four
dimensions—performance, frictions, behavior, and gover-
nance—reporting paired statistics on aligned daily returns with
multiple-testing control. Under realistic transaction costs, em-
pirical results indicate limited incremental value from narrative
signals relative to robust technical baselines, highlighting that
turnover and market impact often dominate net performance.
We address common methodological pitfalls—such as data
leakage, non-stationarity, and missing audit trails—and estab-
lish transparent reporting standards. Adopting a conservative
methodology, we prioritize robust verification over broad claims,
identifying critical pathways for future evidence generation.
