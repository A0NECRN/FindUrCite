本项目旨在构建一个基于多智能体对抗博弈机制（Adversarial Multi-Agent System）的深度学术文献调研系统。针对当前 AI 调研工具普遍存在的“模型幻觉”、分析维度单一以及批判性思维缺失等行业痛点，本系统创新性地设计了由 StudentAgent（研究员角色）与 AdvisorAgent（评审员角色）构成的辩证博弈模型。通过模拟学术界严谨的“同行评审-往复修改”循环，系统不仅实现了自动化的 PDF 全文检索与结构化提取，更能在多轮对抗式辩论中，对文献的创新价值、方法论严谨性以及与研究课题的适配度进行深度审计。FindUrCite 致力于为科研人员提供一个集成“零幻觉”证据链、多维度量化评估指标以及战略性研究建议的自动化科研工作站。其核心创新点在于实现了智能体之间基于证据驱动的对抗博弈架构，显著提升了学术综述的深度与可信度。

This project aims to construct a deep academic literature research system based on an Adversarial Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture. Addressing critical industry pain points such as "LLM hallucinations," superficial analytical dimensions, and the lack of critical reasoning in current AI research tools, the system innovatively introduces a dialectical game model comprising a StudentAgent (Researcher) and an AdvisorAgent (Reviewer). By simulating the rigorous "Peer Review - Revision" cycle ubiquitous in academia, the system enables automated full-text PDF retrieval and structured extraction. Furthermore, it performs in-depth auditing of a paper's innovative value, methodological rigor, and alignment with the research topic through multi-round adversarial debates. FindUrCite is dedicated to providing researchers with an automated workstation featuring a "zero-hallucination" evidence chain, multi-dimensional quantitative metrics, and strategic research recommendations. Its core innovation lies in the implementation of an evidence-driven adversarial game architecture between agents, significantly enhancing the depth and credibility of academic syntheses.
